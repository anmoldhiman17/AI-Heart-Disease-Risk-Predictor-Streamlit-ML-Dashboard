# ❤️ AI Heart Disease Risk Predictor  
### 🏥 AI-Powered Clinical Risk Assessment Dashboard  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

AI Heart Disease Risk Predictor is a modern Machine Learning-powered web application designed to estimate the risk of heart disease based on patient clinical parameters.

This project combines:

- 🧠 Machine Learning (KNN Classification)
- 📊 Interactive Risk Visualization (Gauge Chart)
- 🏥 Clinical-style Recommendation Panel
- 🎨 Modern Glass UI Design
- 🌐 Production Deployment using Streamlit Cloud

The goal of this project is to simulate a hospital-grade AI decision support dashboard for healthcare risk assessment.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Details

- **Algorithm Used:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Feature Scaling:** StandardScaler
- **Encoding:** One-Hot Encoding
- **Problem Type:** Binary Classification (High Risk / Low Risk)

The model predicts the probability of heart disease and visually represents it using an interactive gauge chart for better interpretability.
